/**
 * Values the build injects into the bundle.
 *
 * All four are defined by rollup's `output.intro` (see `rollup.config.js`), so
 * the numbers the card reports are the built ones rather than constants
 * somebody has to remember to bump — which is exactly how `CARD_VERSION` sat
 * at "1.0.0" while the integration was four releases further on.
 *
 * `CARD_SEMVER` is the version from `manifest.json`, the single source of
 * truth for this repository. `CARD_BUILD` is the local build counter
 * (`scripts/build-number.mjs`): it rises with every `builddeploy.sh` build, so
 * a cached bundle is recognisable by its number, and is 0 in a release build.
 * `CARD_VERSION` is what the card prints — `<semver>`, or `<semver>+build.<n>`
 * for a local deploy build.
